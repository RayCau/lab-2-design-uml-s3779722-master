# Software Engineering Fundamentals - Lab #2: Basic Design

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Weighting:** 13.5

This assessment is part of the _individual assessments_ of the course. There are 5 of them, but we only count the _best 4 out of 5_. That means that the worst result won't be taken into account.

Also, you cannot sit the assessment twice: you _must_ sit for the assessment during your corresponding tutorial class.




## Introduction

This assessment evaluates the following CLOs:

- CLO 1: Explain and apply the main aspects of software engineering.
- CLO 3: apply the process of analysis and design using the object-oriented approach
